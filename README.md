# Pyramid-Solitaire

This is my Pyramid Solitaire Game

The goal is to get rid of all the cards in the Pyramid by combining card values that add up to 13.

One example would be J♣ and 2♣ which add up to 13 and are therefore removable (A♣ is worth 1 point) 

The rules:
 - Only 'visible' cards are allowed to be removed (a card is visible if it is not covered but either card above it) 
 - You can only go through the draw pile once
